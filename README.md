# Acceptance tests for OpenStack

### Description

This repo contains Dockerfile to build and run a simple set of acceptance tests for OpenStack. This projects uses modified smoke tests of [openstack/tempest](https://github.com/openstack/tempest) project.

### Pre-words

We created docker parent image with Tempest and prerequisites. It located in  [ykisialiou/tempest-parent](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ykisialiou/tempest-parent/) repo. Tempest has quite large and complicated config, used for all test sets, unfortunately it is full of sensitive data (such as API accessing user with credentials). So, itâ€™s would be better to configure  a lot of options on your side (users credentials, network options, openstack components and features, used on your installation).  tempest.config is self documented and most of options described well. We also provide you config from our testing environment, maybe it will be useful. 

### How to run

The testing process will consist of several steps on your side:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Ykisialiou/tempest-docker.git`.
1. Fill necessary options in `tempest.conf`. You can find some notes bellow.
1. Build docker image: `sudo docker build -t openstack-tests .`
1. Run docker image: `sudo docker run openstack-tests > testing_results`

`testing_results` file is a result of test envokation.

If you look at testing_results file and see errors, it is not necessary you Openstack problems. Sometimes it may be connected with  tempest misconfiguration or bugs.
